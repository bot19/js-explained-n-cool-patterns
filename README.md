# JavaScript explained & cool patterns

Originally a JS deep dive repo by [Software Mastery / TheSeniorDev](https://www.theseniordev.com/). I'll be adding my own cool JS patterns I've come across/generated/created here as well for future reference.

I'll also add to the topics as I learn & grow in them.

## My cool JS patterns

1. [concurrency limited task queue](./00_cool_patterns/01_concurrency_limited_task_queue) 8/2025
2. [timed FIFO queue](./00_cool_patterns/02_timed_fifo_queue) 8/2025
